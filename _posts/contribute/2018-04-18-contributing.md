It's so great that you want to contribute! There are several ways to do this.

 - [Contribute Code](https://www.github.com/vsoch/lessons) meaning these documentation pages
 - [Add A Tutorial](#add-a-tutorial) a snippet of knowledge to render on these pages
 - [Ask a question](https://www.github.com/vsoch/lessons/issues), anything on your mind.


# Add a Tutorial
Each tutorial is in a subfolder of the `_posts` folder of the repository.
For example, if we wanted to find Github tutorials we would find them here:

```bash
ls _posts
    github/

```
