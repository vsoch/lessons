## What is Kerberos?
Kerberos is an authentication method that will give you access to groups of resources
based on tickets that you generate. And yes, Kerberos is also a three headed dog 
from Greek Mythology.

## When would I use Kerberos Authentication?
You will use this method via the tools `kinit` when you need to log into a kerberos
realm. For example, the cluster at Stanford University use Kerberos. 

## How does Kerberos Work?
The general authentication flow looks like this:

```bash
[1. client] --> [2. key distribution center] --> [3. credential] --> [4. login]
```

Briefly, you will use `kinit` from your computer to identify yourself with your email and request 
a ticket from the key distribution center. The ticket will have a life and expiration, and be
used to authenticate you to different realm resources. This is a way oversimplification, and
we point the interested reader to learn more about this workflow by reading 
<a href="http://www.roguelynn.com/words/explain-like-im-5-kerberos/" target='_blank'>this nice post</a>.


## Important Terms

 - a **realm** some set of machines and an associated access policy. The components include a key distribution center, and a set of clients.
 - a **key distribution center** is part of a realm that has an Authentication Server and a Ticket Granting Server
 - a set of **clients** are computers (including yours!) that can be authenticated from.


## Quick Start
If you are on Windows or Mac, you can first download a client called <a href="https://uit.stanford.edu/service/ess/mac/kerberos" target="_blank">Kerberos Commander</a>. If you are on Linux, then you can follow the general instructions provided for
the <a href="http://sherlock.stanford.edu/mediawiki/index.php/SetupKerberos" target="_blank">Sherlock cluster</a>. We will
review these steps here! 

### 1. Install system dependencies
We first install system dependencies, which include the local client and openssh:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install krb5-user openssh-client
```

### 2. Get the configuration file
The configuration for the realm can be obtained by using wget. If you aren't using a Stanford realm, there might
be a different configuration file for you to download, and you would equally want to get the *.conf file that 
describes the realm and output it to `/etc/krb5.conf`

```bash
sudo curl -o /etc/krb5.conf https://web.stanford.edu/dept/its/support/kerberos/dist/krb5.conf
```

Take a look at this file, it's kind of neat! You can see many different realms defined and various
configuration variables.

```bash
cat /etc/krb5.conf
```

### 3. Test your setup.

Remember the step to get your ticket? You will do that by typing `kinit email@stanford.edu`. Then you will see the credential with `klist`.

```bash
$ kinit yourSUnet@stanford.edu
```
```
# See your kerberos ticket:
$ klist
Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_1000
Default principal: yourSUnet@stanford.edu

Valid starting       Expires              Service principal
05/08/2018 07:31:27  05/09/2018 07:31:23  krbtgt/stanford.edu@stanford.edu
```

### 4. Save the setup
We would want to configure ssh (a secure shell) to access resources of interest, for example,
the Sherlock cluster at Stanford! Your computer has a file at `~/.ssh/config` where we can
add variables that will be used for this workflow. Here is how to edit that file so that you can
log in to Sherlock:

```bash
echo "Host *
  GSSAPIDelegateCredentials yes
  GSSAPIAuthentication yes" >> ~/.ssh/config
```

Once that is done, you should be able to login to Sherlock via Kerberos like this:

```bash
$ ssh yourSUnet@login.sherlock.stanford.edu
```
