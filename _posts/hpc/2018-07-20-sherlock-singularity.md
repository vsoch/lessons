This is a followup to our original posts:

 - [sherlock jupyter](https://vsoch.github.io/lessons/sherlock-jupyter/) 
 - [sherlock tensorflow](https://vsoch.github.io/lessons/jupyter-tensorflow/)
 
that described how to get access to a jupyter notebook on Sherlock, with or without
GPU and tensorflow, with port forwarding!

Today we will extend the example to show how to run jupyter via a Singularity container.
We are going to be using a container produced via [repo2docker](https://www.github.com/jupyter/repo2docker)
that was pulled to Sherlock from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/vanessa/repo2docker/) and 
can be used as a general jupyter base, or in a "read only" mode to see the notebook provided by
@vsoch, the author. Why is this cool? It means that you can use the repo2docker tool
to create your own custom container notebooks to share with others. Let's get started!

## What are we doing today?

Today we are going to do the following:

 - configure the [forward](https://github.com/drorlab/forward) tool
 - run a password protected jupyter notebook via a Singularity container on a cluster node
 - access the notebook in a browsr on your local machine

For more background, see the [original post](https://vsoch.github.io/lessons/sherlock-jupyter/).

## Step 1: Download the Repository
First, clone the repository, and remember the location. You will generate a parameters flie
`params.sh` that you can go back to and use again.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/drorlab/forward
cd forward
```

As a reminder from the previous posts, here are the files that we have to work with.

```bash
├── end.sh    (-- end a session
├── resume.sh (-- resume a started session
├── sbatches  (-- batch scripts you can run to forward a port to!
  ├── singularity.sbatch
  ...
  ├── jupyter.sbatch
  └── tensorboard.sbatch
├── setup.sh  (-- run once to set up the tool
└── start.sh  (-- how you start a connection
```

## Step 2: Generate your Parameters

You will need to generate a file of parameters to source before using the tool. Importantly, if you
want to use tensorflow with a gpu, you should select the partition to be "gpu" when it asks you.

```bash
$ bash setup.sh 

Sherlock username > tacocat

Next, pick a port to use.  If someone else is port forwarding using that
port already, this script will not work.  If you pick a random number in the
range 49152-65335, you should be good.

Port to use > 56143

Next, pick the sherlock partition on which you will be running your
notebooks.  If your PI has purchased dedicated hardware on sherlock, you can use
that partition.  Otherwise, leave blank to use the default partition (normal).

Sherlock partition (default: normal) > gpu

Next, pick the path to the browser you wish to use.  Will default to Safari.

Browser to use (default: /Applications/Safari.app/) > /usr/bin/firefox
```

Notice that I've changed the default browser (Safari on a Mac) to firefox on Ubuntu. 
Also note that I entered "gpu" for my partition. The resulting file is a simple text file:

```bash
$ cat params.sh 
USERNAME="tacocat"
PORT="56143"
PARTITION="gpu"
BROWSER="/usr/bin/firefox"
MEM="20G"
TIME="8:00:00"
```

## Step 3: SSH Credentials

Follow the <a href="https://www.sherlock.stanford.edu/docs/getting-started/connecting/" target="_blank">instructions here</a> to set up your Sherlock credentials. You
can see what you have by looking at your `~/.ssh/config`:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/config
```

Don't have the file? You can use a helper script in the repository to generate it.
There is a helper script for Sherlock:

```bash
ls hosts/
  sherlock_ssh.sh
```

and when you run it, the configuration is printed to the screen:

```bash
$ bash hosts/sherlock_ssh.sh 

Sherlock username > tacocat
Host sherlock
    User tacocat
    Hostname sh-ln03.stanford.edu
    GSSAPIDelegateCredentials yes
    GSSAPIAuthentication yes
    ControlMaster auto
    ControlPersist yes
    ControlPath ~/.ssh/%l%r@%h:%p
```

or just do the entire thing programatically:

```bash
bash hosts/sherlock_ssh.sh >> ~/.ssh/config
```

## Step 4. Singularity Usage

Did you notice we skipped the step to set up jupyter passwords on Sherlock? We don't
need to worry about software dependencies because we are using containers. Thank goodness! 
This makes the entire workflow less error prone - the dependencies for jupyter are
packaged in the container! For the example container I'm showing you, the image is provided on Sherlock


```bash
bash start.sh <software> <path>
```

This notebook will serve a basic container, rooted in your directory of choice!

```bash
$ bash start.sh singularity-jupyter /path/to/dir
```

The default will point to your scratch: 

```bash
$ bash start.sh singularity-jupyter

# equivalent to
$ bash start.sh singularity-jupyter /scratch/users/<username>
```

The above command will submit the job, forward the port, and show you the log that has your
token password to enter into the url.

```bash
$ bash start.sh singularity-jupyter
```

The terminal will show you the password to enter when you open your browser, it's a token generated
on the fly. If it doesn't, you can find it in the error or output files:

```bash
SHERLOCK_HOME=/home/users/vsochat
$ ssh sherlock cat ${SHERLOCK_HOME}/forward-util/singularity-jupyter.err
$ ssh sherlock cat ${SHERLOCK_HOME}/forward-util/singularity-jupyter.out
```

When you are ready to be done, or you've left and want to come back later:

```bash
# Resume a session
bash resume.sh <name>
bash resume.sh singularity-jupyter

# End a session
bash end.sh <name>
bash end.sh singularity-jupyter
```

If you want custom software in your container, give [repo2docker](https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io)
a try! For this tutorial, we used the [continuous builder](https://github.com/binder-examples/continuous-build/) template to have the image deployed automatically to Docker Hub.

## I want to run my own container!

This is really easy for you to do! You can use the general Singularity container script,
provided as `singularity.sbatch` in the forward repository to get started. The basic idea is that you would want to:

 1. Create a Github repository with a `requirements.txt` file of things to install
 2. Optionally add jupyter notebooks
 3. Push the image to Docker Hub

And then either pull it to Sherlock with Singularity, or provide the docker uri to the container (and it will be pulled on the fly). The first is generallly recommended. If you need help, please reach out to [@vsoch](https://www.twitter.com/vsoch).


## Debugging

Here are some common pitfalls that I hit during development. If you still need help, please 
reach out to our group!

**There is a missing module!**

This actually happened for me - I got an error message that there wasn't a module called google protobuf.
This is a bug with the installation of tensorflow on sherlock, because it should be loaded if it's required.
No fear! You can fix it yourself, and even from your terminal. First, do this:

```python
import os
os.system("pip install --user <module>")
```

And then restart the kernal from the interface to have changes take effect (you will
get some glorious error messages if you don't).


**The terminal is hanging!**

To make this automated, we issue commands from the `start.sh` script to capture output
from sherlock, using `ssh sherlock` to send the command. If it's the case that your login
session has expired (or you got the wrong password), then you might have a password 
prompt (that you can't see) that looks like the terminal is hanging. If this seems to be
the case, try opening a new terminal window, and authenticating with sherlock again (`ssh sherlock pwd` should trigger the login authentication flow.)

**The job is never allocated**

This usually means there is an error on job submission, and you can look at the error  
and output files to see them. For example, let's say that I want to do this for this run:

```bash
ssh sherlock cat /home/users/vsochat/forward-util/singularity-jupyter.err
ssh sherlock cat /home/users/vsochat/forward-util/singularity-jupyter.out
```

**Failed to setup local forwarding**

If you have a hanging process (if you killed a session and now can't recreate it) you might get an error
message about not being able to set up the port forwarding!  The easiest thing to do here is to use
end.sh and start.sh again.

```bash
bash end.sh singularity-jupyter
```

**There is some other problem, arggg!**
