## Introduction

### What is Keras?

<a href="https://keras.io" target="_blank">Keras</a> is a library that lets you create neural networks.
It's sticking point is that it wants to get you from 0 to trained model in a jiffy. For more detail,
<a href="https://keras.rstudio.com" target="_blank"> read about the integration with R</a>. In this
tutorial, we are going to be stepping through using Keras (via R) on a high performance computing
(HPC) cluster at Stanford, specifically the <a href="https://www.sherlock.stanford.edu/docs/" target="_blank"> Sherlock 2</a>
cluster.

### Credits
This tutorial was made possible by community members:

 - <a href="https://www.github.com/rdrr1990" target="_blank">@rdrr1990</a>: who also took the good initiative to <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/keras/issues/399" target="_blank">open up an issue</a> about some of the troubles with Keras that were discovered! This is a great example of taking open source initiative.


## Container Usage
If you are like me, you don't want to have to do this twice! The benefits of using a container are exactly that.
Once it's built and in a container registry, you don't need to do it again. Today we are going to be writing a Docker recipe called
a <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/" target="_blank">Dockerfile</a>. The benefits of using Docker is that we can convert a Docker image directly to <a href="https://singularityware.github.io" target="_blank">Singularity</a>, and with Singularity
we can use the container on a shared resource. This means that we get *two* birds
with one stone, and only need to maintain one recipe file. I'll save the "how do I create a container recipe" for another
post, let's look at the `keras-r` container!

### 1. Grab an Interactive Node
You should generally not run compute on a login node. If you are working on your local machine, you can skip this
step. If you are on a shared resource, you should jump onto an interactive node. Here is how to do that, asking for
a GPU node:

```
$ srun -p gpu --gres gpu:1 --pty bash
```

 * `srun` is the SLURM executable to run parallel jobs. 
 * `-p` means partiion, which is in reference to a group of worker nodes you have access to.
 * `--gres` means "generic consumable resource," which you can think about is a kind of attribute you are asking for your node. The count of how many comes after the name, so `gpu:1` means that you want one GPU.
 * `--pty` means "pseudo terminal mode" and without it, we wouldn't get an interactive node. 

Asking for an interactive node, period, is important to do because assembling the container can take up enough memory that the process will be killed. It's nothing personal, it's just a friendly reminder that you are sharing the login nodes with other users!


### 2. Setup Singularity
Another terrible situation you can avoid is filling up the default cache (in your $HOME) so that you use your entire
quota, are unable to write files, and then get locked out of your own $HOME. This has happened to me before, and it's
terrible and humiliating because you have to ask research computing to bail you out. By default, Singularity would use $HOME/.singularity
as a cache, so let's tell it to use somewhere else (that doesn't have the space limitation!).

```bash

$ SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=$SCRATCH/.singularity
$ export SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR
```

For a one time definition, you can prepend the variable to a command:

```bash
$ SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=$SCRATCH/.singularity singularity pull docker://ubuntu
```

I find it easiest to put the first export lines in my $HOME/.bash_profile so that I don't need to 
remember to do it. If you just added these lines to yours, just `source $HOME/.bash_profile` to make sure it's
active!

You also need to load the module for Singularity, of course, if it's not already loaded or on your path:

```bash
$ module load singularity

# search for packages
# module spider singularity
```

### 3. Pull the Image
This is the last step! Let's pull the image. It's [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/vanessa/keras-r/) on Docker Hub,
and we pull as follows:

```bash

# One time definition of cache
$ SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=/scratch/users/vsochat/.singularity singularity pull docker://vanessa/keras-r
```
```bash

# After you've exported
$ singularity pull docker://vanessa/keras-r
WARNING: pull for Docker Hub is not guaranteed to produce the
WARNING: same image on repeated pull. Use Singularity Registry
WARNING: (shub://) to pull exactly equivalent images.

```

### 4. Test the Image
We can actually just run the image to get an interactive R session!

```bash

$ singularity run /scratch/users/vsochat/.singularity/keras-r.simg 

R version 3.5.0 (2018-04-23) -- "Joy in Playing"

R Version 3.5 is called "Joy in Playing." What exactly are you playing with, R?
 :) I digress! You can have the same interaction with shell, and then start R on your own:

```bash

$ singularity shell /scratch/users/vsochat/.singularity/keras-r.simg 
Singularity: Invoking an interactive shell within container...

Singularity keras-r.simg:~> which R
/usr/bin/R
Singularity keras-r.simg:~> R
...
```

For a more substantial test, the container has the additional packages `kerasformula`
and `ggplot2`:

```bash

> require(kerasformula)
> require(ggplot2)

> out = kms(mpg ~ ., mtcars)   # use X11 to see epoch-by-epoch progress
> plot(out$history)
```

The above should run without error, and the plot produced is the following:

## Extend the Container
What is the intended use of your container? If it serves as a working environment,
you probably can extend it most easily by installing packages that save to your
$HOME on the cluster (where you have writable). If this is intended for a reproducible
analysis, you can use the container for development but ultimately save all your changes
to the final container for dissemination. We discuss both more in detail.

### Use it as a Working Environment
While containers on the cluster are read only, one (potentially error prone) but
nice feature is that you can maintain a library of packages (installed in your $HOME)
for just your user, and since Singularity mounts your $HOME (where you have write)
it will feel just like installing locally. You should be careful, however,
because **these packages are not being installed into your container!** If you need
a working environment to mess around, this is OK. But if you are creating what you
hope to be a reproducible environment, you really need to go back to the container
recipe and add the packages to be installed (along with your scripts). If you need
help with this step, please 
<a href="https://www.github.com/vsoch/lessons/issues" target="_blank">reach out</a>.


### Use it as a Base for Development
A development container is the same as a working container, but the goals are different.
Your aim is to develop a recipe (and container to share in a registry) that delivers
a frozen version of your software. While this is somewhat possible given that you
can install packages to your $HOME in a read only environment, it's sometimes easier
to develop with a writable image on your local machine. 
How to do this? You would create a container recipe that uses this keras-r container
(or another of your choice) as a base, and add commands on to it. 
Here is how you would use it as a base in a Dockerfile:

```
FROM vanessa/r-keras
```

and in a Singularity Recipe

```

Bootstrap: docker
From: vanessa/r-keras
```

For each, you would start with this base in a `Dockerfile` or `Singularity` recipe
on your local machine (text files with the above text) and then create writable
images that you can shell into and test commands. Your workflow should look like
this:

 1. Build the base image with writable (default with Docker)
 2. Shell into your base container
 3. Test commands, and write those in your recipe that you want to keep

And at the end of each iteration when you are happy with local testing, you can move
the container onto your shared resource and test for the intended use case, which is
likely running something at scale.

### Singularity Example
Given the above text in a file called `Singularity`, to build a writable (sandbox) image, you can do:

```bash
$ sudo singularity build --sandbox sandbox Singularity
```

and then you would want to shell inside **also with writable**

```bash
$ sudo singularity shell --writable sandbox 
```

If you don't have the Singularity file yet and want a quick development environment,
you can do this:

```bash
$ sudo singularity build --sandbox sandbox docker://vanessa/r-keras
```

Notice that the only example is the source of the bootstrap, which is a docker identifier.
And when you like a command, add it to the `%post` section of your Singularity file. 
When you are ready to give the entire thing a test run, build in squashfs (read only)
format:

```bash
$ sudo singularity build my-keras.simg Singularity
```

### Docker Example
My preference for development is to use Docker, and the reason is because the build layers
get cached, and I don't need to wait for long, complicated compile routines as I would with
Singularitys. To build a Docker image, given a `Dockerfile` with the text above:

```bash
$ docker build -t vanessa/r-keras .
```

If you need to disable the cache (for example, a remote resource changes but the file
doesn't have changes and so the cache would be used) you can do this:

```bash
$ docker build --no-cache -t vanessa/r-keras .
```

And there you have it, a handy-dandy container for bringing around Keras, R, and 
other cool things! You can use as is, as a working environment that you customize,
or as a base for your own work.


## Native Usage
If you aren't into using containers, you of course can get this working natively.
We need Python, R, and a few libraries. In the example below, we will use 
<a href="https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/research-development/tacc-projects/lmod" target="_blank">LMOD</a> 
on Sherlock to manage software modules. This basically means you can type "module load" to fuss
around with the path. Without a container, you need to have the libraries and software on
the host, and yes versions matter.


### Step 1: Get an Interactive Node
In the examples below, we are first going to get an interactive node. The
reason is because we should generally not run things on the login nodes! You must
get a GPU node or you will get a bunch of weird errors.


```bash

# Grab an interactive node, you get an hour default!
$ srun -p gpu --gres gpu:1 --pty bash

```



### Step 2: Load Tensorflow

Let's pretend we have forgotten how to find tensorflow. We can use spider to see what is
available:


```bash
[vsochat@sh-08-37 ~]$ module spider tensorflow

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  py-tensorflow:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Description:
      TensorFlow™ is an open source software library for numerical
      computation using data flow graphs.

     Versions:
        py-tensorflow/1.4.0_py27
        py-tensorflow/1.5.0_py27
        py-tensorflow/1.5.0_py36
        py-tensorflow/1.6.0_py27
        py-tensorflow/1.6.0_py36
        py-tensorflow/1.7.0_py27
        py-tensorflow/1.8.0_py27
```

You can also use `module avail tensorflow` for more detailed output.

```bash

[vsochat@sh-08-37 ~]$ module avail tensorflow

--- math -- numerical libraries, statistics, deep-learning, computer science ---
   py-tensorflow/1.4.0_py27 (g)      py-tensorflow/1.6.0_py36 (g)
   py-tensorflow/1.5.0_py27 (g)      py-tensorflow/1.7.0_py27 (g)
   py-tensorflow/1.5.0_py36 (g)      py-tensorflow/1.8.0_py27 (g)
   py-tensorflow/1.6.0_py27 (g,D)

  Where:
   D:  Default Module
   g:  GPU support

Use "module spider" to find all possible modules.
Use "module keyword key1 key2 ..." to search for all possible modules matching
any of the "keys".

```

We are interested in having gpu support, so it's good to see that we have it. Note
that in the above we can choose between python 2 OR 3, and if we just loaded py-tensorflow
without a version string, the default we would get is python 2.7 with tensorflow 1.6.0.
Let's make the assumption that the sys admin had some wise rationale for this to be
default (and the others are user requests?) and use the default.

```bash

$ module load py-tensorflow
The following have been reloaded with a version change:
  1) python/3.6.1 => python/2.7.13
```

It should show you that you are also loading python 2.7. This needs this version
to work, so if you don't see that, make sure you have a Python 2.7 somewhere!
Peeking into the install base for py-tensorflow, we see that loading the module 
basically adds one of these to the path:

```bash

[vsochat@sh-08-37 ~]$ ls /share/software/user/open/py-tensorflow/
1.3.0_py27  1.4.0_py27  1.5.0_py27  1.6.0_py27  1.7.0_py27
1.3.0_py36  1.4.0_py36  1.5.0_py36  1.6.0_py36  1.8.0_py27

```

and here is how to check your python:

```bash

[vsochat@sh-101-58 ~]$ which python
/share/software/user/open/python/2.7.13/bin/python

```

### Step 3: Install Keras API

The Keras API is a Python module, so we install it with pip. 
On Sherlock, we need the open ssl library loaded:

```bash
$ module load libressl/2.5.3
``` 

Install keras as a user:

```bash

$ pip install keras utils np_utils tensorflow --user

```

The `--user` flag will install the extra modules to my $USER home. If we don't do
this, then it would try to install to the system `site-packages` and you would
get a permissions error.


### Step 4: Install R Packages

We need to now install the wrapper for Keras in R, along with other
supporting packages. But first! We need... additional libraries! 
These will be needed to run R.

```bash

$ module load openblas/0.2.19

```

And of course we need to load R

```bash
$ module load R/3.4.0
$ which R
/share/software/user/open/R/3.4.0/bin/R
$ R

```

Oh darn, looks like we only have verison 3.4.0, code name "You Stupid Darkness."
Darkness is good for sleeping, and it inspires insightful reflection.
If you have issues with Darkness, you should complain to the sun. I'm pretty sure the
sun would just engulf you in a fiery arm and go on with his day. Oup, I am digressing again...

Once in R, we can install keras, tensorflow, and reticulate. I'm adding
the extra packages `kerasformula` and `ggplot2` so we can do the same
test as we did previously. To find the python on your path:

```bash

# Here is how I found the path
> system('which python')
/share/software/user/open/python/2.7.13/bin/python
```

Note the below is the 
<a href="https://github.com/vsoch/keras-r/blob/master/install.R" target="_blank">same script</a> 
that I use to generate the container!

```R
install.packages('reticulate')
reticulate::use_python('/share/software/user/open/python/2.7.13/bin/python')
install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('rstudio/keras')

require(tensorflow)
require(reticulate)
require(keras)

Sys.setenv(TENSORFLOW_PYTHON='/share/software/user/open/python/2.7.13/bin/python')
use_python('/share/software/user/open/python/2.7.13/bin/python')

py_discover_config('tensorflow')
py_discover_config('keras')
is_keras_available()

packages = c("kerasformula",
             "kerasR",
             "ggplot2", 
             "dplyr",
             "magrittr",
             "zeallot",
             "tfruns")

for (package in packages) {
    install.packages(package)
}
```

### Debugging

If you didn't get a GPU node, you'd see an error like this:

```bash

> reticulate:::import('keras')
Error in py_module_import(module, convert = convert) : 
  ImportError: cannot import name np_utils

Detailed traceback: 
  File "/home/users/vsochat/.virtualenvs/r-tensorflow/lib/python2.7/site-packages/keras/__init__.py", line 3, in <module>
    from . import utils
  File "/home/users/vsochat/.virtualenvs/r-tensorflow/lib/python2.7/site-packages/keras/utils/__init__.py", line 2, in <module>
    from . import np_utils
```

The real issue is that the tensorflow backend couldn't import CUDA.  You could
verify this by trying to use tensorflow:

```bash

> library(tensorflow)
Error: package or namespace load failed for ‘tensorflow’:
 .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'tensorflow', details:
  call: py_module_import(module, convert = convert)
  error: ImportError: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/share/software/user/open/py-tensorflow/1.6.0_py27/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/pywrap_tensorflow.py", line 58, in <module>
    from tensorflow.python.pywrap_tensorflow_internal import *
  File "/share/software/user/open/py-tensorflow/1.6.0_py27/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/pywrap_tensorflow_internal.py", line 28, in <module>
    _pywrap_tensorflow_internal = swig_import_helper()
  File "/share/software/user/open/py-tensorflow/1.6.0_py27/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/pywrap_tensorflow_internal.py", line 24, in swig_import_helper
    _mod = imp.load_module('_pywrap_tensorflow_internal', fp, pathname, description)
ImportError: libcuda.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

And this ladies and gents is why wrapping things in layers of other things is so dangerous! 
Here is the other issue you might hit, if you want to plot things:

```bash
In (function (display = "", width, height, pointsize, gamma, bg,  :
  unable to open connection to X11 display ''
> 
```

You might try going back and adding `--x11` to your node request.

From personal experience, you can get different results depending on your internet
connectivity, the mirror that you use, and even different system environment variables.
Hence why (in some cases) it's nice to use a container. Some other bugs you might run into:

 - not having a system library like openssl or curl installed and found
 - having a previous attempt lock file that needs to be removed
 - another package dependency missing

This part of R - installing and loading packages - is the most fragile step. Importantly,
when you get an error message **please read the entire text output.** Most of the time,
an error message will tell you exactly what the issue is. If you aren't sure what it
means, try a Google search. If you are still lost, then contact research computing support.


### Step 5: Test it Out!

Activate your new packages in the session:

```R

> require(tensorflow)
> require(reticulate)
> require(keras)
 
``` 
  
Let's now test as we did before!

```bash
> require(kerasformula)
> require(ggplot2)

> out = kms(mpg ~ ., mtcars)   # use X11 to see epoch-by-epoch progress
> plot(out$history)
```

I'll spare you the redundant picture! It looks the same.

### The Next Time
The next time around, since you have everything installed, you mostly need to load
things again. You can have a small script to do that. You would run this on
an interactive node.

```
$ srun -p gpu --gres gpu:1 --x11 --pty bash
```
```bash

#!/bin/bash
module load py-tensorflow
module load R/3.4.0
module load openblas/0.2.19
exec R

# And then interact with keras
```

I hope that you can see the huge benefit of using a container here. With the container,
 you can go to a cluster **anywhere** that has Singularity installed, and be up and running
just in the amount of time it takes to pull the container. The native method, although using
modules, is fragile because of the huge number of dependencies. You very likely will log in
at some future date, and it won't reproduce, and you may not know why. A colleage on a different
resource also can't easily reproduce your software. As a strong example, just in deriving this
native example with another user on Sherlock, it took me over a few days to get working "the exact same
thing," primarily because of subtle differences in modules and libraries that were loaded. Save your
future self the time and figure out your software base **once**, put it in a container, and be done!
