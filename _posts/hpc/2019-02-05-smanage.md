Today I want to introduce you to a script, [smanage.sh](https://www.github.com/esurface/smanage)
created by [@esurface]( https://www.github.com/esurface) from Harvard Research Computing.
smanage <strong>manage</strong>s jobs running on a 
<strong>s</strong>lurm compute cluster. It was developed in bash to take advantage of the automatic output from the [slurm programs available on the command line](https://slurm.schedmd.com/pdfs/summary.pdf), namely sacct and sbatch. 

## What do I need this for?

After you launch a bunch of jobs, it's hard to keep track of them. How many completed?  How many crashed
and failued in a horrific ending of memory exceed exceptions? In a nutshell, smanage enables you to submit and track large batches of jobs beyond the MaxArraySize limit set by slurm. 


## What is a job array?

Wait, but what is a job array anyway? If you are used to submitting jobs on a SLURM cluster, you are probably used to the standard sbatch command:

```bash
$ sbatch myanalysis.job
```

If you are like me, you've probably written some kind of Python/R/Bash or other
script that loops through some set of variables and programmatically
generates and/or submits job files. [Here is an example](https://github.com/vsoch/image-comparison-thresholding/blob/master/preprocessing/run_make_group_maps.py#L19).
of some of the nonsense that I (contributor @vsoch) went through in graduate school.
If only I had known about job arrays!

> a job array lets you submit a ton of similar jobs using a template script.

Actually, it's just another SBATCH header. It looks like this:

```bash
#A job array with index values of 1, 2, 5, 19, 27:
#SBATCH --array=1,2,5,19,27
```

How would we use this? Let's start with a simple example, and say that we have
100 text files to process. We have them in a folder, and they are labeled 
cookie1.txt through cookie100.txt. We could use arrays to process these files
without any extraneous for loops:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -J cookies-job # A single job name for the array
#SBATCH -n 1 # One Core
#SBATCH -N 1 # All cores on one machine
#SBATCH -p owners # Partition name
#SBATCH --mem 2000 # Memory (2Gb)
#SBATCH -t 0-1:00 # Maximum execution time (D-HH:MM)
#SBATCH -o cookie_%A_%a.out # Standard output
#SBATCH -e cookie_%A_%a.err # Standard error
#SBATCH --array=1-100   # maps 1 to 100 to SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID below

/bin/bash "${SCRATCH}/cookies/cookie${SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID}".txt
```

We would then submit that one job file, and 100 jobs would be run to process our
cookie text files!

```bash
$ sbatch cookie-job.sbatch
```

That's the essense of a job array. It's actually exactly as it sounds - an array
of jobs.

## Why a tool like smanage?

Once you launch your jobs, you lose them to some extent because they are all individual.
jobs. There are technically command line ways to interact and control them, but
it's yet another hard-to-learn thing and (wouldn't it be nice) if there was a tool
to manage arrays for us?

This is the goal of smanage. Now that you understand, let's briefly look at usage.
For more detailed examples, see the [smanage repository](https://www.github.com/esurface/smanage).
If you want to learn more about Job arrays, check out this [AskCI post](https://ask.cyberinfrastructure.org/t/what-are-good-uses-for-job-arrays/733/3).

# Usage

## Local

For local usage, you can install the script by adding an alias to the program. First, wget it.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/esurface/smanage/master/smanage.sh
chmod u+x smanage.sh # makes it executable
```

Run the following line of code or copy it into the file '~/.bashrc' to make it permanent:

```bash
alias smanage='<pathto>/smanage.sh'
```

smanage has two basic modes described below.

## Step 1. Write a Dummy Job

To really see how this works, we need to write a dummy job. Let's write one
that will simply sleep for a bit, and exit. Here is our sbatch job file,
called `sleepy.sbatch`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -J sleepy-job
#SBATCH -n 1
#SBATCH -N 1
#SBATCH -p owners
#SBATCH --mem 1000
#SBATCH -t 0-0:03
#SBATCH --array=1-100   # maps 1 to 100 to SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID below

echo "This is job number ${SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID}"
sleep 120
```

We will launch this job like this:

```bash
sbatch sleepy.sbatch
```

and then use it to learn about the different commands for smanage below.

## Report Mode (default): smanage report

The reporting mode gives you a summary of your jobs. Here is what we see after
launching sleepy.sbatch above.

```bash
[vsochat@sh-ln06 login /scratch/users/vsochat/sleepy]$ smanage report
Finding jobs using: /usr/bin/sacct -XP --noheader
Found jobs: 35512888
0 COMPLETED jobs
0 FAILED jobs
0 TIMEOUT jobs
98 RUNNING jobs
0 PENDING jobs

2 jobs with untracked status
```
We could have also used squeue:

```bash
[vsochat@sh-ln06 login /scratch/users/vsochat/sleepy]$ squeue -u vsochat
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
  35386489_[1-100]    owners sleepy-j  vsochat PD       0:00      1 (None)
```

How does the first commad work? It parses and summarized the output from sacct.
Here is what the output looks like when I've launched a TON of jobs - note that
we truncate the job numbers so it's readable.

```bash
$ smanage report
Finding jobs using: /usr/bin/sacct -XP --noheader
Found 1016 jobs: 36094475,36123253,36160821,36160826,36160831,36160945,36160947,36160950,36161025 (and more)
569 COMPLETED jobs
0 FAILED jobs
15 RUNNING jobs
1 PENDING jobs
```

Now we can try the command and look specifically for our "sleepy-job" by name.
Let's run the command again, so we get two sets of sleepy jobs.

```
$ sbatch sleepy.job
$ smanage report --sacct --name=sleepy-job
Finding jobs using: /usr/bin/sacct -XP --noheader --name=sleepy-job
Found jobs: 35386489,35386615
100 COMPLETED jobs
0 FAILED jobs
0 TIMEOUT jobs
0 RUNNING jobs
51 PENDING jobs
```

Now we see the first 100 completed, and the second batch are started up!
Under the hood, this is using ` 'sacct --array' named "sleepy-job"`.
If you are familiar with sacct, any sacct commands can be added to
this command. For example, to report the jobs ran on a specific date,
we might do this:

```
$ smanage report --sacct --name=sleepy-job --starttime=2019-01-07
```

You can also add the '--verbose' flag to add more useful information about the jobs.

```
$ smanage --verbose report --sacct --name=sleepy-job --verbose --state=COMPLETED
```


## Reporting Errors and Submitting Jobs

The examples above outline the simple reporting feature of smanage, which is 
likely what you will find most useful. For advanced users, know that smanage also
handles reporting errors and customized job submission. For these advanced examples,
or to ask a question or get help with the tool, see [the smanage repository](https://www.github.com/esurface/smanage).
